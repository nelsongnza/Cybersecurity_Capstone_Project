Group 34 - Cybersecurity Capstone Project - Oct 2020

Messaging System Web-Based

It is for Participate in the Build-it, Break-it, Fix-it contest to test your skills at building secure software, and breaking software vulnerable to attack.

Over the next 2 weeks, you will develop and deploy your system with your team. You will share the URL to your project through the Peer Review tool,
"Project Evaluation" in Week 3. At the end of these 2 weeks, you will evaluate other team projects according to the rubric provided.

We are Group 34, and until now, no one answered the call to join and participate in this group ...

This project will be evaluated by other teams. This rubric describes the criteria they will use for the evaluation and the points awarded.

Security Usability Analysis
Score for the project team is 2 X the sum of ratings on the final question’s scale. 50 points total. Also answer the following descriptive questions.

What are the password requirements?
Could a user who just wants to access the system as quickly / easily as possible circumvent the security measures with insecure behavior (e.g. a “12345” password, etc.)?
If there is password-based authentication…
How easy is it for a person to memorize this password? Is it easier or harder than a standard 8-character password that requires upper case, lower case, numbers, and punctuation? Justify your answer with principles of memory such as the 7+/-2 rule, chunking, etc.
Please indicate More Usable, Equally Usable, Less Usable and provide a reason.
If there is no username-password authentication, but something else in its place…
How usable is this alternative to a standard 8-character password? Justify with principles of usability: speed, efficiency, memorability, learnability, user preference. Please indicate More Usable, Equally Usable, Less Usable and provide a reason.
If there are authentication measures beyond the initial authentication step…

What are the additional steps?
How long to the additional steps take to complete (time it)?
How usable are the additional steps? Justify with principles of usability: speed, efficiency, memorability, learnability, user preference.
Rate the user experience with the authentication mechanism on this site on the following scale. Note that you are not rating how secure it is, only the experience for the user:

Go ahead and ejoy this vulnerable system for testing,
Kind Regards,
